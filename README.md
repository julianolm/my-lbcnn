# Local-Binary-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This repo contains my own implementation of a LBCNN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06049).
The tested architecture used 512 randomly generated anchor weights (LBC filters), 10 LBC blocks (20 convolutional layers), 16 output channels in each LBC block and 384 hidden units in the fully connected layer, achieving 79.23% accuracy. This same architecture was refered to get 82.74% accuracy in the original article.
